# Todo List Application

# Overview
This is a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript todo list application with a modern Bootstrap dark-themed frontend. The application provides a clean interface for managing tasks with features including search, filtering, and pagination. It uses the DummyJSON API (https://dummyjson.com/todos) as a backend service for todo operations. No server-side framework is required - it runs entirely in the browser.
